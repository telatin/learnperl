Conference in the Cloud (A Perl and Raku Conference) 2020 - Lightning Talk

# Distributing a Perl module via Bioconda (Miniconda)

### When you develop a tool that requires external applications (or compiled binaries), CPAN is not the easies way of distributing it. I'll show how Miniconda became the favourite package manager in the bioinformatics community, with a tiny tutorial using the "BioConda channel" as an example.

Perl has a long history of serving the bioinformatics community, and nowadays "Miniconda" has become the most used package and dependency manager for bioinformaticians, with a very active channel called "BioConda". In this lighting talk I'll use BioConda as an example of bringing Perl tools (and modules) to Miniconda. 
In spite of Miniconda being born in the Python world, 10% of all Bioconda packages are Perl modules, and several highly downloaded programs are written in Perl.
